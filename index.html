      The Internet and all that it enables is a vast new frontier, full of
      amazing challenges. There is room for great innovation. Don't be
      constrained by today's technology. Reach out and imagine what could be and
      then make it happen. <br />-Leonard Kleinrock

    <p id="Introduction">
      I am a junior at Oakland University studying Information Technology. I
      have worked on a couple group projects for classes in Java, and I've also
      individually developed a chat bot in Python. Most of my professional
      experience comes from working at help desks. I'm currently working for
      Oakland University at the Housing Technology Helpdesk. Overall, I have
      developed outstanding customer service skills along with problem-solving
      capabilities. Head over to my
      <a href="./html/my_resume.html">resume page</a> for more details. If
      you're interested in what I do outside of Information Technology, check
